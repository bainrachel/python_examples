Script for reading, cleaning, and plotting water level data stored in a text file.

The data in this example are publicly-available water level measurements from the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). However, the original
NOAA data have been reformatted, and several errors have been added to the raw
data file for teaching purposes.

This script was written in Python 3.9.7.
